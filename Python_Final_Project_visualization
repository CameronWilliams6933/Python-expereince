## 1.Problem Statement: The data that i choose to examine was one taken from 
## http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/frames/frame.html
## I wanted to analyze correlation between the data of how annual percipitation would effect Adult antelope Size population,
## how adult antelope Size population effects Spring Fawn count, 
## and how winter Severity can also effect the size of adult deer population.

## 2.Related Work: Since most of my college career consisted of relying on statistical analysis to examine patterns, data, and 
## correlations, it was only natural for me to want to find answers from the data at hand to come up with visualizations that 
## made sense. Most of my analysis and visual work comes from using Rstudio rather than python so i tried to do something
## simple and recognizable for my first visual in Rstudio. 

## 3.Solution: The way that i went about solving the problem was by using correlation analysis, the analysis seeks to find out
## if there is any cause and effect relation within the data. We can see that the larger the adult population is the more fawns that are 
## birthed during the spring time, this means that there is a positive correlation between the two. The same goes for the more 
## percipitation the more the adult population grows, this gives us another positive correlation analysis. On the flip side,
## we can see that the more severe the winter is the smaller the antelope popualtion is.
