This is my first time using the unit testing package from python, 
I had used previous code from another assignment to test. 
Im not sure how it is suppose to help with debugging seeing how in the virtual IDE i can use the dbugger that is offered online, 
i wasnt sure exactly what to do, i will be waiting for Dr. Freidmans answer sheet
